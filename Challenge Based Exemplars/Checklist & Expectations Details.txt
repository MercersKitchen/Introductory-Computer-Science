What these prompts should illustrate
- how code will read like a book, probably paragraph
- how drawing occurs on a coordinate plane but is controlled by "paperfolding"
- the importance of paper folding and Case Studies in GUI Design

Flat Coding Snippets: exemplar assignments
- Hello World
- Draw a Rectangle in Canvas exactly as a paper Case Study (paper folding is acceptable)
- Draw a composite shape using only rect parameters as variables
  - Layering within Measles (sequential code with copy and paste or WHILE Infinite Loop)
- Draw image & aspect ratios

Dynamic Coding Snippets: exemplar assignments
Purpose: introductions to FOR & IF
- Quit Button (illustration of code to copy and paste into all programs)
- Draw a button to control two events ("Do this Not That")
- Adding single song controlled by keyboard or multiple buttons
