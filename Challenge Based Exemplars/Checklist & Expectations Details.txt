3. Draw text to a screen
4. Draw images to a screen using aspect ratio (collage project)
  - How to Create a paragraph with images
5. Composite Images (Snow Globe, Measles, etc.)
  - Composite Shape using only rect values & sequential layers in visual data
  - Learn that parameters can be formulae based on geometry ratios
6. 3 by 3 Assignment including random colour, text, and images
  - - Introduce Modular Design
  - Population of Variables by FOR and automatic counting
  - Creating a Button controlled by a Boolean and IF
    Adding Hover over
  - Learn Global Variables, setup(), draw(), keyPressed(), mousePressed()
7. Drawing Program (including background song and sound effects using mouse)
8. Music Program (including sound effects using key board and mouse)
9. Final Project: using Ketai Library

All programs will be tested on any size window and fullScreen (i.e. Find and Replace)

What these prompts should illustrate
- how code will read like a book, probably paragraph
- how drawing occurs on a coordinate plane but is controlled by "paperfolding"
- the importance of paper folding and Case Studies in GUI Design

Flat Coding Snippets: exemplar assignments
- Hello World
- Draw a Rectangle in Canvas exactly as a paper Case Study (paper folding is acceptable)
- Draw a composite shape using only rect parameters as variables
  - Layering within Measles (sequential code with copy and paste or WHILE Infinite Loop)
- Draw text
- Draw image & aspect ratios

Dynamic Coding Snippets: exemplar assignments
Purpose: introductions to FOR & IF
- Quit Button (illustration of code to copy and paste into all programs)
- Draw a button to control two events ("Do this Not That")
- Adding single song controlled by keyboard or multiple buttons
- Adding sound effect controlled by single button that matches visual data metaphor
- Draw an illusion like "Snow or Rain in Localized Space" or "Measles on a Face"
  - Layering within setup() & draw()
- 3 x 3 Summary Assignment
